# Connect4 Deep Q-Learning project using PyTorch

## A fully functional Q-Learning project written in python documenting the stages of development

This project was created as part of my AQA A-level Computer Science NEA with the purpose of creating an adaptive algorithm targeted towards a user's skill in connect4. 

## Project Objectives

* Predefined model/memory written to file
* Must allow a user to select game preference
* Must successfully display a connect 4 game board
* Model should assess board position and determine whether it should play more aggressively or not
* After a fully finished game, the win rate of the agent/player should be displayed hyperparameters
* Allow user to play the game multiple times after
